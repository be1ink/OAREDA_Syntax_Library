See the slides from the **[Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://rpubs.com/betsyrosalen/CUNY_OAREDA_GitHub)** workshop by Betsy Rosalen presented in the OAREDA GitHub training sessions beginning November 17th 2022 for a very brief intro to **what Git and GitHub are** and **how to use them to store version history and collaborate on projects**.

You can also view the **recordings of the OAREDA GitHub Training sessions** in the Data AID MS Team / Git Users Channel / Files / **[GitHub Training folder](https://cuny907.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/TechnicalTeamOIRAREPSDMA/EmhEWWH_0G1CpW3Jf_2MZnkBJN_WYPc0lSD-D3PFB3eaUA?e=KPIgjc)**.
